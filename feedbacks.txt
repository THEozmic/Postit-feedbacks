1. Return relevant data only
2. Use only json responses
3. Stick with the style guide: http://jsonapi.org/
4. When returning a json response, group related resources into an object e.g an array of messages
5. Don't return sensitive data e.g Passwords. I think it would be nice to ask for clarification on "sensitive data"
6. Hash your passwords
7. Place your token in headers not it body and always use the "x-" prefix for custom headers
8. Fields should be validated. e.g: Passwords cannot be blank, Phone should have only numbers
9. Group name should be unique
10. Catch all errors and return only custom ones
11. All errors must have a useful message put in an "error" attribute
12. Use correct status codes: https://httpstatuses.com/
13. If possible, don't let incorrect data reach the database for validation, make use of controllers instead
14. When returning a dataset, be sure to include appropriate relations to avoid avoidable network calls
